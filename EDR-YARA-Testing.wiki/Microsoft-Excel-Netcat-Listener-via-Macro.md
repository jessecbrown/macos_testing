**Detections**
* Enterprise EDR Solution 1: Yes (Blocked)
* Enterprise EDR Solution 2: Yes - Upon retest
* Enterprise YARA Solution: No

Used a macro in excel to create a netcat listener.

Created an excel sheet then added some VBA code to run a netcat listener once the sheet is opened. Note that excel prompts the user on whether or not they want to enable macros, but a typical user will often just enable it.

Opened the excel sheet on our endpoint, Enterprise EDR Solution 1 detected and blocked this. Two detections triggered, one for netcat and one for excel. The excel executable file was also quarantined which broke the appâ€™s functionality until quarantine was reverted. Note that the file itself is not quarantined. VBA code is below:

Enterprise EDR Solution 2 had indicated they were able to reproduce this on their end and a detection had triggered. They said the initial miss was likely due to the fact that the sensor was disabled and later re-enabled which can cause an impact on some detections. Upon retest, Enterprise EDR Solution 2 did detect this but did not block or quarantine.
